        <h1 class="aboutme">What Are We Waiting For?</h1>
        <p class="aboutmetext">Ramadan is coming up in about a month bi ithniLLAH.
            Have we started preparing ourselves spiritually?
            No doubt some of us have started going shopping for the pantry, some might even already be window shopping for Eid gifts,
            forgetting the most important aspect of the blessed month is attaining Taqwa by performing and drowning ourselves in various acts of worship.</p>
        <p class="aboutmetext">We know we cannot wake up on the days of doubt (the 2 nights right before Ramadan) with the highest level of eemaan and state of mind,
            ready to take on the month-long journey towards Jannah (whose gates are wide open) without having prepared our hearts for this month-long event.
            If we were preparing for a triathlon, we would start exercising months in advance. Why not do the same for this glorious month of Ramadan.</p>
        <p class="aboutmetext">I advise myself and you all to challenge yourself in this next month. Print off our Eeman chart for Ramadan and begin using it
            even before Ramadan starts. Make it a point to fill in each section every day and be conscious about what you observe
            (the state of your eemaan/heart/improvement/preparation for Ramadan) before the beginning of Ramadan and afterwards in shaa Allah. </p>
        <p class="aboutmetext">Don't be lazy, many are those who will read this post but may not witness the month of Ramadan. Make your intention to be better TODAY and do not delay. </p>
        <p class="aboutmetext">May Allah make us be from those who will witness Ramadan and be successful in this life and in the hereafter, aameen. </p>

        <p class="aboutmetext">"Ramadaan has arrived to you, a month of barakah (blessing), Allaah envelops you (with His mercy & blessings),
            so He descends His mercy, erases the sins, answers your dua'as, and He watches your competition in virtuous deeds and He boasts in front of the angels about you.
            So, let Allaah see the best from you, for truly, the miserable one is he who is deprived from the mercy of Allaah (in this month)."
            [Tabaraanee, Saheeh]</p>

                Always remember that a distracted heart cannot focus on proper worship. If you are used to chatting with your friends on a regular basis, make it short.

                    <b>Cooking:</b>
                      Try to cook something simple during Ramadaan as this is a month of 'Ibaadah & Qur'aan, not the month of food.
                      There are some husbands who request that their wives cook different varieties of food. Sisters/brothers end up spending most of their time in the kitchen.
                      If it's very necessary, keep the Qur'aan playing in the kitchen & listen to it while you are busy, or keep your tongue moist with the Dhikr of Allah.
                      Find out ways and short cut tips to prepare the food quickly. Make food that won't take as much time as others.

                    <b>Dinner Parties/Iftaar:</b>
                      Iftaar parties during ramadaan were common before the pandemic. Hopefully we all realised how much time was saved when we were all on lockdown and didn't have the means to interact as we normally did in pre-pandemic Ramadaans.
                      We have the rest of the full year to do parties & to socialize. We must maximize every minute we have in the month of Ramadaan.
                      Indeed, it's a great reward to break someone's fast but, give food to people who are needy & poor.

                    <b>Shopping:</b>
                      Get all your shopping done before Ramadaan commences. Make a list of the things/grocery items, that is enough for one month & buy it all together.
                      Important: Do your eid shopping NOW. Don’t wait until the last ten days of Ramadaan (when we have to be doing more ‘Ibaadah) to do your eid shopping.
                      In these last ten days, we have to be laser focused on maximizing the days and nights of it, aiming to be from those who will succeed in worshipping on Laylatul Qadr.

                    In order to be successful in Ramadaan, you must give your body its right. Split your night into portions for rest as well as portions for 'Ibaadah.
                    It is not normal for us to spend all day sleeping because we are fasting and didn't get some rest in the night. There is time for everything.
                    Sleep some at night, and take sufficient naps during the day to help keep a measured balance.
